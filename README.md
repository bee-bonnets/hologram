# Hologram

Hologram is a mod... It adds jokers, and will probably add more in the future. It requires Steamodded (I have tested it on 01711a), which requires lovely, though this mod does not use it itself. Below, see a list of the seven jokers in the mod, and their effects.
Please let me know if you run into any issues.

## List of Jokers

**Minimal Joker** - *Common* -
